 * to EP 0x01 by a background sender, so the sender must stop FIRST, and only
 * then may an abort sequence be pushed to the printer. Otherwise the abort
 * bytes interleave with live PCL XL data (the printer ignores both) and the
 * job keeps printing — exactly the old "Cancel does nothing" behaviour.
