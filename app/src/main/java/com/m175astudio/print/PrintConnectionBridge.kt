/**
 * Hands the system PrintService a UsbPrinterConnection WITHOUT fighting
 * the app for the USB interface claim.
 *
 * Android allows only ONE UsbDeviceConnection per interface claim. The
 * MainActivity normally holds the claim for its whole lifetime, so a
 * service-side claimInterface() either fails (old behaviour: "printing
 * from other apps never worked") or steals the claim and wedges the app.
 *
 * Policy:
 *  - acquire(): if the app's registered connection is already OPEN, it is
 *    handed over as SHARED (the app keeps it after the job). Otherwise the
 *    bridge creates an OWNED connection for the service (app is dead —
 *    safe to claim and close later).
 *  - release(conn): closes OWNED connections; SHARED ones are left intact.
